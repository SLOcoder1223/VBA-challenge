# VBA-Challenge
VBA Homework Assignment

Project Description:
The VBA Challenge is Homework Assignment #2. With this assignment, we learned how to use VBA to automate what would be repetitive tasks in excel. 

Features:

From there, I isolated a few specific tickers based on their performance (highest vs lowest % growth, greatest total volume).
